## FluentAssertions.Web
This is a FluentAssertions extension for HttpResponseMessage to help with the **Assert** part and to extract enough information during the **Fail** part, so less time in debugging is spent.

## Examples

Checks if a response is HTTP 200 OK. The Test Detail Summary will contain information about the response and and the request, providing the a similar experience as intercepting it with Fiddler. 

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Post_ReturnsOk()
{
    // Arrange
    var client = _factory.CreateClient();

    // Act
    var response = await client.PostAsync("/api/comments", new StringContent(@"{
              ""author"": ""John"",
              ""content"": ""Hey, you...""
            }", Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));

    // Assert
    response.Should().Be200Ok();
}
```

![FailedTest1](https://github.com/adrianiftode/FluentAssertions.Web/blob/master/docs/images/FailedTest1.png?raw=true)

Checks if a response is HTTP 400 BadRequest and it contains an expected error. 
The Test Detail Summary will contain information about the response so it is much faster and easier to investigate why is the assert failed.
This is also very useful on build server when contextual data is lost and some tests might not be possible to be repeated on the developer machine.

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Post_WithNoAuthor_ReturnsBadRequestWithUsefulMessage()
{
    // Arrange
    var client = _factory.CreateClient();

    // Act
    var response = await client.PostAsync("/api/comments", new StringContent(@"{
                                  ""content"": ""Hey, you...""
                                }", Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));

    // Assert
    response.Should().Be400BadRequest()
        .And.HaveError("Author", "The Author field is required.");
}
```
