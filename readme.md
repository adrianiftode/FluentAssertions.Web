## Assertions.Web

HTTP assertions for .NET that turn a failing test into the whole request and response conversation, so you debug less.

The repository is home to a family of assertion frameworks on top of the shared [`Assertions.Web`](https://github.com/adrianiftode/FluentAssertions.Web/tree/master/src/Assertions.Web) contract and the [`HttpMessageFormatter`](https://github.com/adrianiftode/FluentAssertions.Web/tree/master/src/HttpMessageFormatter) request/response renderer.

## The libraries

| Package | For | Assertion style |
|---|---|---|
| [**FluentAssertions.Web**](#fluentassertionsweb) | FluentAssertions < 8.0.0 | `response.Should().Be200Ok()` |
| [**FluentAssertions.Web.v8**](#fluentassertionswebv8) | FluentAssertions >= 8.0.0 (commercial) | `response.Should().Be200Ok()` |
| [**AwesomeAssertions.Web**](#awesomeassertionsweb) | AwesomeAssertions | `response.Should().Be200Ok()` |
| [**Shouldly.Web**](#shouldlyweb) | Shouldly 5 (prerelease) | `response.ShouldBe200Ok()` |
| [**Assertions.Web.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson**](#optional-global-configuration) | Newtonsoft.Json serialization, shared by every flavour | — |
| [**HttpMessageFormatter**](#httpresponse-formatter) | Standalone request/response formatter | — |

Every flavour targets `netstandard2.0`, packs its own copy of the `Assertions.Web` contract and renders failure output with the shared `HttpMessageFormatter`. The first four packages differ only in the assertion framework they extend; the assertions themselves are the same set, exposed through each framework's native syntax.

## Quick starts

### Quick start: FluentAssertions.Web

```csharp
response.Should().Be200Ok();
response.Should().BeAs(new { Author = "John", Content = "Hey, you..." });
response.Should().HaveHeader("X-Correlation-ID").And.Match("*-*");
response.Should().Satisfy<IEnumerable<Comment>>(comments => comments.Should().HaveCount(2));
```

```shell
dotnet add package FluentAssertions.Web
```

### Quick start: FluentAssertions.Web.v8

The same code as above (starting with FluentAssertions 8.0.0 FluentAssertions is a commercial product, so it ships as a separate package depending on the commercial versions):

```shell
dotnet add package FluentAssertions.Web.v8
```

### Quick start: AwesomeAssertions.Web

`Should()` and `And` work exactly like in the FluentAssertions flavour:

```shell
dotnet add package AwesomeAssertions.Web
```

### Quick start: Shouldly.Web

With Shouldly the assertions are called directly on the response and there is no `Should()`/`And` chaining — each assertion is its own call:

```csharp
response.ShouldBe200Ok();
response.ShouldBeAs(new { Author = "John", Content = "Hey, you..." });
response.ShouldHaveHeader("X-Correlation-ID");
response.ShouldMatchInContent("*\"author\"*");
```

> Prerelease: Shouldly.Web is in preview until Shouldly 5.0.0 is stable, and requires Shouldly >= 5.0.0-preview.2 (`EquivalencyOptions`).

```shell
dotnet add package Shouldly.Web
```

### Quick start: Newtonsoft serializer

```shell
dotnet add package Assertions.Web.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson
```

```csharp
AssertionsWebConfig.Serializer = new NewtonsoftJsonSerializer();
```

### Quick start: HttpMessageFormatter

```shell
dotnet add package HttpMessageFormatter
```

```csharp
using HttpMessageFormatter;

var formatted = response.Format();
```

## When a test fails, you see the whole conversation

Every failure message produced by this library is followed by **the complete HTTP response _and_ the originating HTTP request** — status line, headers and both bodies, the same way an HTTP interceptor like Fiddler would render them. There is no need to attach a debugger or to watch `response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result` anymore: the reason for the failure and the payload that caused it are already in the test output.

A typical test:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Post_ReturnsOk()
{
    // Arrange
    var client = _factory.CreateClient();

    // Act
    var response = await client.PostAsync("/api/comments", new StringContent(
    """
    {
      "author": "John",
      "content": "Hey, you..."
    }
    """, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));

    // Assert
    response.Should().Be200Ok();
}
```

Running this with `dotnet test` against an endpoint that answers `201 Created` instead of `200 OK` prints:

```text
  Failed Sample.Api.Tests.CommentsControllerTests.Post_ReturnsOk [614 ms]
  Error Message:
   Expected response to be HttpStatusCode.OK {value: 200}, but found HttpStatusCode.Created {value: 201}.

The HTTP response was:

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://localhost/api/Comments/1
X-Correlation-ID: 42c3a077-12ec-470e-8569-ddeaade90127
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "author": "John",
  "content": "Hey, you...",
  "commentId": 1
}

The originating HTTP request was:

POST http://localhost/api/comments HTTP 1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 50
{
  "author": "John",
  "content": "Hey, you..."
}
  Stack Trace:
     at FluentAssertions.Execution.XUnit2TestFramework.Throw(String message)
   at FluentAssertions.Execution.TestFrameworkProvider.Throw(String message)
   at FluentAssertions.Execution.DefaultAssertionStrategy.HandleFailure(String message)
   at FluentAssertions.Web.HttpResponseMessageAssertions.Be200Ok(String because, Object[] becauseArgs)
   at Sample.Api.Tests.CommentsControllerTests.Post_ReturnsOk()
--- End of stack trace from previous location ---
```

The same text is shown in the *Test Detail Summary* of Visual Studio and Rider, and ends up in the CI logs, so the failure can usually be assessed without even running the test locally:

![FailedTest1](https://github.com/adrianiftode/FluentAssertions.Web/blob/master/docs/images/FailedTest1.png?raw=true)

A couple of details about that output:

- when there is no originating request (for example because the `HttpResponseMessage` was created by hand), the last section reads `The originating HTTP request was <null>.`
- when the response content is disposed it is reported as `***** Content is disposed so it cannot be read. *****`
- when the response content is bigger than `ResponseFormatterOptions.MaximumReadableBytes` (1.25 MB by default), it is truncated and a `***** Content is too large to display and only a part is printed. *****` warning is printed instead — see [Response Formatting](#response-formatting)

## Why?

Writing tests for ASP.NET Core APIs and or any APIs by using the HttpClient classes leads to some repetitive code and also often to an incomplete one. When the test fails, the developer needs to debug the test in order to assess the failure reason, as the test itself did not usually consider what happens in this case.

Thus this library solves two problems:

##### Focus on the Assert part and not on the HttpClient related APIs, neither on the response deserialization

Once the response is ready you'll want to assert it. With first level properties like `StatusCode` is somehow easy, especially with FluentAssertions/AwesomeAssertions, but often we need more, like to deserialize the content into an object of a certain type and then to Assert it. Or to simply assert something about the response content itself. Soon duplication code occurs and the urge to reduce it is just the next logical step.

##### Debugging failed tests interrupts the programmer's flow state
 When a test is failing, the following actions are taken most of the time:
- attach the debugger to the line containing ```var response = await client..```
- debug the failing test
- add an Watch for ``` response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result ``` and see the actual response content

**And this can be avoided**, if the *Test Detail Summary* contains the request and the response information, providing a similar experience as with an HTTP interceptor like Fiddler. See [When a test fails, you see the whole conversation](#when-a-test-fails-you-see-the-whole-conversation) for the exact output.

## Full documentation

### Assertions at a glance

```csharp
response.Should().Be200Ok();                                               // status codes: Be200Ok, Be404NotFound, Be400BadRequest, Be5XXServerError, ...
response.Should().Be400BadRequest().And.HaveError("Author", "*required*"); // validation errors carried by a 400 response
response.Should().BeAs(new { Author = "John" });                           // the body is equivalent to an object
response.Should().Satisfy<IEnumerable<Comment>>(comments =>               // any assertions over the deserialized body
    comments.Should().HaveCount(2).And.OnlyHaveUniqueItems(c => c.CommentId));
response.Should().HaveHeader("X-Correlation-ID").And.Match("*-*");         // headers
response.Should().MatchInContent("*\"author\"*");                          // raw content
```

For the Shouldly flavour this is the same set of assertions, written Shouldly-style — see [Shouldly.Web](#shouldlyweb) below.

### FluentAssertions.Web Examples

- Asserting that the response content of an HTTP POST request is equivalent to a certain object

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Post_ReturnsOkAndWithContent()

    // Arrange
    var client = _factory.CreateClient();

    // Act
    var response = await client.PostAsync("/api/comments", new StringContent(
    """
    {
      "author": "John",
      "content": "Hey, you..."
    }
    """, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));

    // Assert
    response.Should().BeAs(new
    {
        Author = "John",
        Content = "Hey, you..."
    });
}
```

### Full API

The tables below list every assertion. Each group is followed by a short example and, where it helps, by the `dotnet test` output you get when the assertion does not hold, so it is clear what is actually being reported. The names apply to the FluentAssertions and AwesomeAssertions flavours; the [Shouldly.Web](#shouldlyweb) section maps them to the Shouldly naming.

|  *HttpResponseMessageAssertions* | Contains a number of methods to assert that an HttpResponseMessage is in the expected state related to the HTTP content. |

### FluentAssertions.Web

#### FluentAssertions.Web vs FluentAssertions.Mvc vs FluentAssertions.Http

**FluentAssertions.Web** does not extend the assertions for the ASP.NET Core *Controllers*, if you are looking for that, then consider [FluentAssertions.Mvc](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions.mvc).

When FluentAssertions.Web was created, [FluentAssertions.Http](https://github.com/balanikas/FluentAssertions.Http) also existed at the time, solving the same problem when considering the asserting language.
Besides the extra assertions added by FluentAssertions.Web, an important effort is put by this library on what happens when a test fails.

#### The HttpResponsesMessage assertions from FluentAssertions vs. FluentAssertions.Web

In the [6.4.0](https://fluentassertions.com/releases/#640) release FluentAssertions introduced a set of related assertions: *BeSuccessful, BeRedirection, HaveClientError, HaveServerError, HaveError, HaveStatusCode, NotHaveStatusCode*.

This library can still be used with FluentAssertions and it did not become obsoleted, not only because of the rich set of assertions, but also for the comprehensive output messages that are displayed when the test fails, feature that is not present in the main library, but in FluentAssertions.Web one.

### FluentAssertions.Web.v8

Starting 8.0.0, FA is not an FOSS anymore. **FluentAssertions.Web** will maintain both FOSS (< 8.0.0) and the Commercial versions of FA (>= 8.0.0), so they will be deployed as separate Nuget packages:
    - **FluentAssertions.Web** will continue to dependend on the FOSS versions
    - **FluentAssertions.Web.v8** will dependend on the Commercial versions

### AwesomeAssertions.Web

AwesomeAssertions.Web is the AwesomeAssertions flavour of the same assertions. It exposes the identical `Should()`/`And` API as the FluentAssertions flavour, so all the examples and the [Full API](#full-api) above apply unchanged. It depends on AwesomeAssertions instead of FluentAssertions.

### Shouldly.Web

Shouldly.Web is the Shouldly flavour, a community-maintained, unofficial extension that is **not endorsed by the Shouldly project**. It requires Shouldly >= 5.0.0-preview.2 and is itself prerelease until Shouldly 5.0.0 is stable.

Instead of `response.Should().Be200Ok()`, Shouldly's `ShouldlyMethodsAttribute` lets the same assertions be called directly on the response, and each assertion returns `void` — there is no `Should()`/`And` chain, so every assertion is its own call (you can also pass a custom message as the first optional argument):

```csharp
response.ShouldBe200Ok();
response.ShouldBe400BadRequest();
response.ShouldHaveError("Author", "*required*");
response.ShouldBeAs(new { Author = "John", Content = "Hey, you..." });
response.ShouldSatisfy<IEnumerable<Comment>>(comments => comments.ShouldHaveCount(2));
response.ShouldHaveHeader("X-Correlation-ID");
response.ShouldMatchInContent("*\"author\"*");
```

> No chaining is available in the Shouldly flavour: the assertions return `void`, so each call is a standalone assertion.

The named assertions map to the FluentAssertions/AwesomeAssertions ones described in the [Full API](#full-api) section:

| FluentAssertions.Web | Shouldly.Web |
|---|---|
| `Should().Be200Ok()` | `ShouldBe200Ok()` |
| `Should().BeAs<T>()` | `ShouldBeAs<T>()` |
| `Should().BeEmpty()` | `ShouldBeEmpty()` |
| `Should().HaveHeader()` / `NotHaveHeader()` | `ShouldHaveHeader()` / `ShouldNotHaveHeader()` |
| `Should().HaveHeader().And.BeValue()` | `ShouldHaveHeaderWithValue()` |
| `Should().HaveHeader().And.BeValues()` | `ShouldHaveHeaderWithValues()` |
| `Should().HaveHeader().And.Match()` | `ShouldHaveHeaderMatching()` |
| `Should().HaveHeader().And.BeEmpty()` / `NotBeEmpty()` | `ShouldHaveEmptyHeader()` / `ShouldHaveNonEmptyHeader()` |
| `Should().Satisfy<T>()` / `Should().Satisfy()` | `ShouldSatisfy<T>()` / `ShouldSatisfy()` |
| `Should().MatchInContent()` | `ShouldMatchInContent()` |
| `Should().HaveHttpStatusCode()` / `NotHaveHttpStatusCode()` | `ShouldHaveHttpStatusCode()` / `ShouldNotHaveHttpStatusCode()` |
| `Should().HaveLocation()` etc. | `ShouldHaveLocation()`, `ShouldHaveLocationWithValue()`, `ShouldHaveLocationWithValues()`, `ShouldHaveLocationMatching()`, `ShouldNotHaveLocation()` |
| `Should().Be400BadRequest().And.HaveError()` | `ShouldHaveError()` |
| `Should().Be400BadRequest().And.OnlyHaveError()` | `ShouldOnlyHaveError()` |
| `Should().Be400BadRequest().And.NotHaveError()` | `ShouldNotHaveError()` |
| `Should().Be400BadRequest().And.HaveErrorMessage()` | `ShouldHaveErrorMessage()` |

The failure messages follow the Shouldly layout, so the expected/actual values are rendered as `should be`/`but was`, followed by the same HTTP conversation dump. When a custom message is passed it is reported under `Additional Info`:

```text
  Failed Sample.Api.Tests.CommentsControllerTests.Post_ReturnsCreated [614 ms]
  Error Message:
   response.StatusCode
    should be
HttpStatusCode.Created
    but was
HttpStatusCode.OK

Additional Info:
    we need it

The HTTP response was:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

The originating HTTP request was <null>.
  Stack Trace:
     ...
```

The dump after `The HTTP response was:` is produced by the same `HttpMessageFormatter` the other flavours use, so everything said about the [failure output](#when-a-test-fails-you-see-the-whole-conversation) applies here as well.

### Optional Global Configuration

> **Breaking in 3.0:** the separate holders `FluentAssertionsWebConfig` and `AwesomeAssertionsWebConfig` are replaced by the single `AssertionsWebConfig` (from `Assertions.Web`, referenced by every flavour), which carries both `Serializer` and `ResponseFormatterOptions`.

#### Deserialization

##### System.Text.Json

By default `System.Text.Json` is used to deserialize the response content. The related `System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions` used to configure the serializer is accessible via the `SystemTextJsonSerializerConfig.Options` static field from Assertions.Web. So if you want to make the serializer case sensitive, then the related setting is changed like this:

```csharp
SystemTextJsonSerializerConfig.Options.PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = false;
```

The change must be done before the test is run and this depends on the testing framework. Check the NewtonsoftSerializerTests from this repo to see how it can be done with xUnit.

##### Newtonsoft.Json

The serializer itself is replaceable, so you can implement your own, by implementing the `ISerializer` interface.
The serializer ships as the single **Assertions.Web.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson** package, shared by every flavour:

```
dotnet add package Assertions.Web.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson
```

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Assertions.Web.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson.svg?label=Assertions.Web.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Assertions.Web.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson)


To set the default serializer to **Newtonsoft.Json** one, use the following configuration:

```csharp
AssertionsWebConfig.Serializer = new NewtonsoftJsonSerializer();
```

The related `Newtonsoft.Json.JsonSerializerSettings` used to configure the Newtonsoft.Json serializer is accesible via the `NewtonsoftJsonSerializerConfig.Options` static field. So if you want to add a custom converter, then the related setting is changed like this:

```csharp
NewtonsoftJsonSerializerConfig.Options.Converters.Add(new YesNoBooleanJsonConverter());
```

#### Response Formatting

The assertion failure messages include a readable rendering of the HTTP response (see [When a test fails, you see the whole conversation](#when-a-test-fails-you-see-the-whole-conversation) for an example). By default, only the first `10 * 128 * 1024` bytes of the response content are printed, the rest being replaced by a warning message. To change this limit globally, set the `ResponseFormatterOptions`:

```csharp
AssertionsWebConfig.ResponseFormatterOptions = new HttpResponseFormatterOptions
{
    MaximumReadableBytes = 4 * 1024
};
```

The change must be done before the test is run, like for the serializer configuration above. The global options only apply to the messages produced by the assertion packages. The **HttpMessageFormatter** library itself keeps no global state and accepts the same `HttpResponseFormatterOptions` parameter object per call:

```csharp
var formatted = response.Format(new HttpResponseFormatterOptions
{
    MaximumReadableBytes = 4 * 1024
});
```

### HttpResponse Formatter

The internal HTTP Request/Response formatter used by the assertion packages is published as a standalone package, so it can be reused in other projects.

Basic usage:
 - start from an HTTPResponseMessage instance
 - reference the HttpMessageFormatter package from Nuget
 - import the extension method _using HttpMessageFormatter;_
 - call the *Format* method on the HttpResponseMessage instance

 ```csharp
using HttpMessageFormatter;

public class HttpResponseFormatterExtensionsTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void GivenUnspecifiedResponse_ShouldFormatBasicResponse()
    {
        // Arrange
        using var subject = new HttpResponseMessage();

        // Act
        var formatted = subject.Format();

        // Assert
        Assert.Contains("The HTTP response was:", formatted);
        Assert.Contains("HTTP/1.1 200 OK", formatted);
    }
}

```
