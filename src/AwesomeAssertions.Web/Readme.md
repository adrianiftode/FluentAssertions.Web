# AwesomeAssertions.Web

An [AwesomeAssertions](https://awesomeassertions.org/) extension over the `HttpResponseMessage` object. It provides assertions specific to HTTP responses and outputs rich error messages that include the HTTP Request and Response, so test failures show the whole conversation and less time with debugging is spent.

## Install

```shell
dotnet add package AwesomeAssertions.Web
```

## Example

The assertions and the `Should()`/`And` syntax are identical to the FluentAssertions flavour:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Post_ReturnsOk()
{
    // Arrange
    var client = _factory.CreateClient();

    // Act
    var response = await client.PostAsync("/api/comments", new StringContent(
    """
    {
      "author": "John",
      "content": "Hey, you..."
    }
    """, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));

    // Assert
    response.Should().Be200Ok();
}
```

When the assertion fails, the test output contains the expected and actual status codes followed by the complete HTTP response and the originating HTTP request.

## Documentation

The shared [Assertions.Web documentation](https://github.com/adrianiftode/Assertions.Web/blob/master/docs/Assertions.Web/Readme.md) describes the assertions at a glance, the failure output, the configuration and links to the [full API](https://github.com/adrianiftode/Assertions.Web/blob/master/readme.md#full-api) and the [worked examples](https://github.com/adrianiftode/Assertions.Web/blob/master/readme.md#fluentassertionswebawesomeassertionsweb-examples) in the repository readme.
